description: Apply a Frostyard-branded documentation site to an existing project repo. Use when a Frostyard project needs docs that live with source — creates site/ (Astro, Markdown/MDX, Pagefind), seeds content from the README, wires Cloudflare Workers deploy.

# Frostyard docs site — apply procedure

Adds a static documentation site at `site/` in the current repo, in the Frostyard design language (docs shell: top bar · section tree · prose · TOC). Content is Markdown/MDX in `site/content/`, edited in the same PRs as code. The scaffold payload lives next to this file in `scaffold/`.

Brand rules for any content you write: sentence case headings, product names lowercase, calm declarative tone, no emoji, glyphs limited to `❄ ✦ ↗ ← →`.

## Pre-flight

1. **Abort if `site/` already exists** — never overwrite. Tell the user and stop.
2. Derive config values; when a source is missing, ask the user instead of guessing:
   - `name` — repo name from `git remote get-url origin` (strip `.git`), else the directory name. Lowercase.
   - `kicker` — GitHub description via `gh repo view --json description -q .description`; if empty, ask for a 3–6 word descriptor.
   - `sourceUrl` — the origin remote as an https URL. No remote → ask.
   - `url` — default `https://<name>-docs.bjk.workers.dev`; flag this as a guess in your summary.

## Apply

3. Copy the payload: `cp -R <this skill's directory>/scaffold site` (then delete any `site/node_modules`, `site/dist`, `site/.astro` that came along).
4. Fill the four values in `site/src/site.config.ts`.
5. Set `"name"` in `site/wrangler.jsonc` to `<name>-docs`.
6. Append to the host repo's `.gitignore` (create it if missing):

   ```
   site/node_modules/
   site/dist/
   site/.astro/
   ```

7. Seed content: rewrite `site/content/getting-started/overview.md` from the repo's README (keep the frontmatter shape; follow the brand rules above). Keep `concepts/example.mdx` as the MDX reference. Ask the user whether to keep or delete the remaining sample pages.

## Verify (required before declaring done)

8. `cd site && npm install && npm run build` — must exit 0 (Astro build + Pagefind index).
9. Offer `npm run dev` for a visual look.

## Tell the user about deploys

- `cd site && npm run deploy` → Cloudflare Workers static assets (needs `wrangler login` once).
- Any static host works: serve `site/dist/`.
- CI: move `site/.github-workflow-deploy.yml` to `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`, uncomment it, add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets.

## Content authoring reference

- Frontmatter (all pages): `title` (string), `description` (optional string), `group` (sidebar section), `order` (number; global sort key — also orders prev/next).
- Plain `.md` needs nothing else. `.mdx` can `import Callout from "../../src/components/Callout.astro"` and use `<Callout label="...">…</Callout>`.
- Two pages must not share a filename-derived slug; the build fails if they do.
